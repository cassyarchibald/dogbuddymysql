# DogBuddy 
This project was focuses on allowing dog owners to search for dogs within a mile radius/to send playdates to dogs for their own dogs. 

## Motivation 
I was inspired to build this project when I moved to a new town and my dog no longer had a playmate. I wanted dog owners to be able to browse nearby dogs to see if any of them would be a good match for their own dogs. Also, not all dogs do well meeting at dog parks with dogs of different sizes/play styles. This would allow the owners to have more control over the environment their dogs play in.

## Features 
 - Users can create a profile for themselves/their dogs 
 - Users can browse all the dogs in the database or dogs within a mile radius of a zip code 
 - Users can send playdates between one of their dogs/another dog 
 - Users can approve/deny recieved playdates 
 
 ## Tech/Framework Used 
 - This project uses Spring Boot and MySql database to create an api 
 - This project also uses Firebase for a Google OAuth login 
 
 ## Installation 
 - Download a Spring IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc) to edit/run the code 
 
 ## Other
